**Fill Out Your Time Sheet**

We have an issue remembering to fill out our time sheets. This is hopefully going to solve that problem

*Add Time For Each Differnt Task You Worked On Today*

Using the predefined list of tasks (grabbed from a google sheet) the app will allow you to quickly set the time that you spent on all the tasks for easy submission.
This will also grab the current date and use that to make sure we are updating the correct day. (Maybe we should have the option to go back a day?)
This will require us to also check we have not already entered data for this day. Or we could just ignore that and overwrite. We will have to see

*Create and Update Current Time Sheets*

We also want to make sure we are changing over time sheets each week so that we can keep a record of each week of work.
